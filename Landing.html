    <p>Yep, that's me (from two years ago, I'm not one to take many selfies)! I am a student at the University of Advancing Technology. 
        <br>
        This landing page, as well as the other two linked pages, were created as part of my CSC102 course for my final project. 
        <br>
        This final was the culmination of five weeks worth of learning HTML and javascript. Prior to this, I had zero knowledge of programming. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While I'm no expert, I think it's safe to say I've come far in a short amount of time!
